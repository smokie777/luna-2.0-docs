This is the documentation for https://github.com/smokie777/luna-2.0.

It is deployed at https://smokie777.github.io/luna-2.0-docs/.

Docs are written in Markdown, styling is done in SCSS, and components/pages are built in React.

My motivations for working on this project were as follows:

1. To create a reference for understanding, bootstrapping, running, operating, and contributing to the luna-2.0 AI VTuber project
2. To create a sample or portfolio of my technical writing/documentation engineering skills, as I'm interested in breaking into these fields.
