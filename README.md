(this project is currently under construction)

This is the documentation for https://github.com/smokie777/luna-2.0

This project exists for several reasons:

1. To serve as a reference on how to understand, bootstrap, run, and operate the more complicated aspects of the project
2. To serve as a sample or portfolio of my technical writing skills, as I'm interested in breaking into the technical writing field
3. To allow others to more easily understand and collaborate on the luna-2.0 project, if interested
