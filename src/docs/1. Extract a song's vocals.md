3. Input the audio file path, and the desired output folder
4. Click **Start Processing**
5. Keep both the split vocals file, and the split instrumental file.

Note: the higher quality the split vocals file, the better the AI cover will be. Ideally, the split vocals should be clear, have minimal reverb/echo, and have as few artifacts as possible. It is recommended to cut out any artifacts before proceeding to the next step. A high quality vocals file may also be obtained via a live recording performed by someone who is skilled at singing. A live acapella recording will almost always turn out better than vocals split out using software.
