# 2. Create AI vocals cover

The split vocals file can be run through [RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion)](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI/blob/main/docs/en/README.en.md) to produce an AI cover of the song's vocals.

This requires an RVC model trained using audio samples of the AI VTuber's TTS voice. A model like this can be obtained in one of two ways:

1. Train it locally
   - This requires AI knowledge, a GPU with ideally 24GB VRAM, and a potentially increased electricity bill.
2. Commission it from a site like [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/search/gigs?query=RVC)
   - This might cost you $20 for a fairly decent model.

Using the successfully trained model, run inference using RVC:

1. Open RVC, and ensure the following settings are correct:

- **Inferencing voice**: select the trained model (.pth file)
- **Index file path**: path of the index file (.index file)
- **Audio file path**: path of the split vocals file from Step 1
- **Pitch extraction algorithm**: crepe
- **Search feature ratio**: 0.5
- **Transpose**: adjust this value to change the pitch of the AI cover. Usually, good inference results occur when the pitch of the output is similar to the natural speaking pitch of the audio samples used to train the RVC model.

2. Click **Convert**
3. **Download** the resulting AI vocals cover file, and listen to it to ensure quality.
   - Note: the downloaded file will have much higher audio quality than the audio in the **Export audio** preview section.
