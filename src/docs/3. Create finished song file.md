# 3. Create finished song file

The AI vocals cover produced by RVC and the split instrumental track produced by UVR can now be combined using any audio editing software, such as Audacity, to produce a finished song file.

1. Open Audacity
2. Import AI vocals cover file

   - Clean up and delete any vocal artifacts from the AI vocals conversion process
   - Add reverb effect for a more professional sound

3. Import split instrumental file, onto a separate track

   - Adjust pitch of instrumental track to match RVC transpose value, if needed

4. Adjust volume of both vocal and audio tracks
5. Export the finished song file!
6. Also export a copy of the AI vocals cover only, with -9.0 dB gain applied. This file will be used for lip syncing in VTube Studio.
