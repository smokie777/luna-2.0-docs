# 3. Create finished song file

The AI vocals cover produced by RVC, and the split instrumental track produced by UVR, can now be combined using any audio editing software such as [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/), to produce a finished song file.

1. Open Audacity
2. Import AI vocals cover file

   - Clean up and delete any audio artifacts created by the AI vocals conversion process
   - Add reverb effect for a more professional sound

3. Import split instrumental file onto a separate track

   - Adjust pitch of instrumental track to match RVC transpose value, if needed

4. Adjust volume of both vocal and audio tracks as needed
5. Export the finished song file!
6. Also export a copy of the AI vocals cover only, with -9.0 dB gain applied. This reduced volume audio file help VTube studio achieve the best lip syncing results.
