# 4. Play the song live!

With the finished song file, luna-2.0 can now sing the song live!

1. Save the finished song file from Step 3 as `songname_iv.wav` in [/songs](https://github.com/smokie777/luna-2.0/tree/main/python/songs).
   - This file will be played through your computer's default audio playing program, such as Windows Media Player.
2. Save the reduced volume split audio file from Step 3 as `songname_v.wav` in [/songs](https://github.com/smokie777/luna-2.0/tree/main/python/songs).
   - This file will be sent through a virtual cable into VTube studio, so that the VTuber can lip sync along with the song.
3. Add the name of the song `songname` to [songs.ts](https://github.com/smokie777/luna-2.0/blob/main/javascript/control_panel/src/songs.ts)
4. Prepare the streaming environment for playing the song:
   - Turn off microphone in Streamlabs
   - Turn off the VTuber's audio in Streamlabs
   - Turn off the VTuber's audio preview in VTube Studio
5. Play the song through the control panel!
   - Type `songname` in the control panel input box, and click **Sing**
