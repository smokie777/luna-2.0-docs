# Singing

### The AI VTuber has a singing functionality.

The singing workflow uses voice conversion AI tools such as [RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion)](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI/blob/main/docs/en/README.en.md) to prepare an AI cover of a desired song, so that it can be played through a virtual cable connected to VTube Studio, allowing the VTuber to lip sync along with the song.
